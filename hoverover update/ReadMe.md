I started to work on the project from August 27 afternoon. I just came back from one week vacation from August 10 to August 20. 

I got assignment on Monday, but I told the coworker that we can talk about Tuesday afternoon. I like the idea. 

First day at work, August 26, I noticed that SQL server management studio stopped functioning. I could not update the database table content manually, and then I calmed down to look into issues, and then I checked the event log, and then found out disk space of C drive is almost empty. I spent the time to handle the issue, and I was so glad to learn that I came back vacation on time.

**CSS box model** <br>

This is a really fun project for me to warm up CSS, html and JavaScript and Jquery. I like to put the title in front of first item, and I need to push to left position. A few problems came out. 

First, I set left: -100px;, but the text was cut off. So I know that there is something next to my current box. What I did is to turn overflow: hidden from hidden to visible. But I could not do that, since my page next button stops working. I have to set CSS style on when mouse hover over, and off when mouse hover off. 

Next, I found another interesting problem. There is width for my text. I found out that I need to work on width:100%, which should be increased to over 150%. 

I also notice that CSS box model is so interesting to work with. I do not invest time last two years to enhance my knowledge. It is so much fun to look into CSS tricks, and then foundation of CSS model is so user-friendly. 


**JavaScript coding**<br>

I do not have a lot of code to write. If I stay the current frameworks for the website, then I only need to write less than hundreds of lines code every time. I am hunger for problem solving, I always like to explore and find interesting projects to work on. 

One thing is to push myself to write beautiful working JavaScript code. 

Here is the code I wrote this time. I created a comparison. I like to push myself to figure out the idea how to make JavaScript code easy to maintain. 

The comparison is [here](https://github.com/jianminchen/ProjectManagement/blob/master/hoverover%20update/step%204%20development/ComparisonWork.jpg). 


**Why software engineer should work on frontend?**<br>

I think that the small project is a good demonstration that a software engineer should work as frontend designer as well. I like to work on frontend. It takes good engineering work in order to complete the task. I also make tradeoff how to update CSS: overflow: visible/ invisible by adding CSS dynamically. 

**Pitfall analysis**<br>
One of issues is that the page may show up some intermediate results. I may need to work on the issue later.
