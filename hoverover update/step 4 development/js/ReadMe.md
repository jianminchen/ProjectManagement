It is a small project, but I did spend last three days to work on and I released new version on MPLighting.com on August 29, 2019. 

I did write some JavaScript code. I like the experience to write JavaScript code, it is so much fun and I do believe that it is so enjoyable to write code, since I have practiced so many Leetcode algorithms. I came out ideas quickly to try and make it easy to maintain. 

[Here(https://github.com/jianminchen/ProjectManagement/blob/master/hoverover%20update/step%204%20development/js/hoverover/Interior/Ingrade.js) is JavaScript code to maintain Ingrade menu items.
