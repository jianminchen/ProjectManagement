I started to work on the project from August 27 afternoon. I just came back from one week vacation from August 10 to August 20. 

I got assignment on Monday, but I told the coworker that we can talk about Tuesday afternoon. I like the idea. 

First day at work, August 26, I noticed that SQL server management studio stopped functioning. I could not update the database table content manually, and then I calmed down to look into issues, and then I checked the event log, and then found out disk space of C drive is almost empty. I spent the time to handle the issue, and I was so glad to learn that I came back vacation on time. 

Second day I print out all source code related to the feature, I reviewed a few things first. 

1. CSS - how to set up text blocks over image?

hoverover with text content is same idea as the idea written in the following article.

2. Jquery - warm up mouseover event 

3. Work with Google chrome browser, and capture what kinds of html and css update with hoverover event handling
I saved a few images to help me understand how it works.
