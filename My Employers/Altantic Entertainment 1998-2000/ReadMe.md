I like to document small projects I work on. The idea is to document how I approach the problem solving, and later I can look into how to improve my project management skills. <br>

What are measured will be improved. <br>

I spent three days to work on the project. August 28, 29, 30. Total time is 24 hours. <br>

I will add my offer letter and other documents here for future references.
