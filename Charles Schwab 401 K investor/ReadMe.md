I like to document small projects I work on. The idea is to document how I approach the problem solving, and later I can look into how to improve my project management skills. 

What are measured will be improved. 

I have written some blogs related to my lessons related to par 401 K. [Here](http://juliachencoding.blogspot.com/search?q=par+401+K) is the link to read the portfolio. 

I wrote a lot of blogs related to this portfolio. I owned the portfolio starting from 2017. But I did not spend enough time to pay attention to the statements, and funds available and platform I have. I should study the basics how to invest as well.
