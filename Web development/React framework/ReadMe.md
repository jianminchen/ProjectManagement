I like to learn react.js quickly. What I can do is to google the react framework, and find good articles to read, and then quickly figure out what I should learn, how to learn. <br>

First hour learning is [here](https://caferati.me/demo/react-awesome-slider), I always like to read the article and support peopl who likes to write and share. 

[Here](https://www.framer.com/blog/posts/react-for-web-designers/) is another page I read.
