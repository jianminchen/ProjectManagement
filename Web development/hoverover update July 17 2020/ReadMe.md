I love to code using JavaScript. It was my favorite programming language, but I was afraid to practice and make so many mistakes, so I stop coding using JavaScript until recently for a project called hoverover features. <br>

At work, the marketing coordinate likes to show the size of LED lighting fixture, so images are rendering to apply same ratio for same menu, like interior/ exterior ingrade. <br>

I will save a picture as the project specification. <br>

I was lazy to learn JavaScript daily, weekly or monthly. So I struggled a few days and got myself back to the business as a JavaScript programmer. It was fun. I like to code for a good product feature, and pursue my excellence through project management. <br>
