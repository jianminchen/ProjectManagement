I like to document small projects I work on. The idea is to document how I approach the problem solving, and later I can look into how to improve my project management skills. 

What are measured will be improved. 

I had three onsite interview with Amazon in 2016, 2018 and 2019. Amazon leadership is so challenging for me to master. One of ideas is to learn project management, basics of leadership skills. 

Another thing I like to do is to work on research related to career, and how to determine what is my next move.
