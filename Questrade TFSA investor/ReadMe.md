I like to document small projects I work on. The idea is to document how I approach the problem solving, and later I can look into how to improve my project management skills. 

What are measured will be improved. 

I opened TFSA account on questrade.com on May 2019. I started to learn and also invest on stock market. My portfolio is called Victoria. I write blogs about Victoria once a while on my blog. 

[Here](http://juliachencoding.blogspot.com/search?q=victoria+portfolio) is the link to read about my Victoria portfolio. 

I decide not to time the market, and prepare for the worst, invest into USA economy as an index fund investor.
