I like to document small projects I work on. The idea is to document how I approach the problem solving, and later I can look into how to improve my project management skills. 

What are measured will be improved. <br>

How to make a six month study plan?<br>
I need to figure out how to study system design. Study every day, try to cover a few areas. <br>
One idea is to read a good book, so I can understand the basics first; And then I need to get into habit to watch some technical talk video, I start to understand the challenges in the large distributed system; And then I also need to constantly quiz myself about knowledge. <br>
Algorithm and data structure practice, I like to set some goal as well. One of ideas is to solve another 100 algorithms. I need to look into some basics as well. <br>
