I like to document small projects I work on. The idea is to document how I approach the problem solving, and later I can look into how to improve my project management skills. 

What are measured will be improved. 

I had onsite for one hour in Westin hotel, city of Vancouver in January 2015. After that, I started to write juliacodingblog.com. 

In August 2018, I had a phone screen, but I could not clear the phone. 
In August 2019, I had onsite interivew in MPK, California. 

I like to do more research on large distributed system, and also study 100 managers profiles on Linkedin.com working for Facebook. I like to understand what makes those people successful in terms of career, education and all other things.
