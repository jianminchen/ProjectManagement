How to prepare for more important job? Dean Jackson 

Business sense - PM 
TL signal - teaching or mentoring - leadership role 

One of answers is here:

Google and Facebook both seem to look for two things:

Can you code in a language they use, or something similar? Do you know data structures and algorithms?
Can you design larger systems? Do you ask questions, make tradeoffs well, and accomplish what you were asked to do?
Facebook (more than Google) also seems to dig for a third category for engineers:

Can you communicate well, do you work well solo and in groups, and would you be a decent human being to be stuck with in an airport? Are you a leader who can drive things on your own, and/or drive things organically across teams or even full organizations?
Finally, there are honestly some bonus-point things that might help, and might not, depending on recruiter and whatnot:

PM signal: do you have business sense? Can you make solid business decisions?
TL signal: Have you ever done any teaching or mentoring, or been in a leadership role?
Coworker wins: volunteerism/community service, etc.
