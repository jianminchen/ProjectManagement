I like to document small projects I work on. The idea is to document how I approach the problem solving, and later I can look into how to improve my project management skills. 

What are measured will be improved. 

I went to Microsoft onsite in 2008 September. I also had a few phone screens from Microsoft starting from 2009 to 2019.
